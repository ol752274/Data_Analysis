About the dataset:
work_year, experience_level, employment_type, job_title, salary, salary_currency, salary_in_usd,
employee_residence, remote_ratio, company_location, company_size
Tasks:
1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration
• Load the dataset using pandas.
• Display the first 10 rows of the dataset.
• Check for missing values and data types of each column.
- TASK 1: Load the Data Successfully
Question 1: How many missing values are there in each column?

2. Data Cleaning and Transformation
• Handle the missing values appropriately (e.g., fill with mean/median/mode or drop).
• Perform necessary type conversions (e.g., converting object types to datetime or
categorical).
- TASK 2: Clean the data
Question 2: What transformations did you apply to handle missing values and type
conversions?
3. Descriptive Analysis
• Calculate descriptive statistics for numerical columns.
• Perform group-by operations and aggregation to find meaningful insights.
- TASK 3: Find number of employees based on
1. Years of Experience
2. Job Title
3. Salary_Currency

Question 3: What are the mean, median, and standard deviation of the numerical
columns? Provide insights from group-by operations.

Assignment: Data Analysis Mini-Project

4. Data Visualization (EDA)
• Create at least three different types of visualizations (e.g., bar plots, histograms,
scatter plots, heatmaps,) to explore the relationships and distributions in the data.
• Use matplotlib, seaborn visualization libraries.
• Find yearly trend of jobs. (Increase or decrease in jobs over the years)
• Plot Salary Distribution Histogram, Box plot
• Plot employee residency trends.
• Company Size trends, Remote Trends, and Count Plots of these features.
